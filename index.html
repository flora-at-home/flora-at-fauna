  <p class="w3-center"><em>What is Hydroponics</em></p>
  <p>The Oxford Dictionary defines <b>Hydroponics</b> as <i>"the process of growing plants in sand, gravel, liquid with added nutrients but without soil."</i> </p>
        <p>Hydroponics does not use soil. However, the root system requires to be supported by medium. Some commonly used medium is Coco-peat, Clay Pellets, Rock Wool and in some cases various sized pebbles. The sole purpose of the medium is to provide mechanical support. The nutrients required by the plant are directly added to the water that is taken in by the roots. Almost all plants can be grown through various types of Hydroponics </p>

   <p class="w3-center"><em>Types of Hydroponics</em></p>
   <p>There are 6 basic types of Hydroponic systems. All the variations are developed from any one or a combination of these systems.</p>
  
   <p>The Wick System is the simplest Hydroponic System. A growth tray and a growing medium with plants is mounted on a reservoir with nutrient solution. The nutrient solution is drawn up from the reservoir using wicks.</p>

<div class="w3-row">

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
  
<p>The Water Culture System is basically consists of a floating platform that is made in such a way that it holds the plants directly over the nutrient solution in a reservoir. This is comparatively a less expensive method of Hydroponics. Water loving plants like Lettuce can be ideally grown using this system.</p>

   <p>The Flood and Drain system is also called as Ebb and Flow System. As the name suggests the growing tray is temperately flooded with the nutrient solution. The solution is then drained into the reservoir. This alternation of flooding and draining has to be controlled in a rhythmic manner by using a timer and a pump that is submerged in the reservoir.</p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of Drip Systems â€“ the RECOVERY DRIP SYSTEM and the NON-RECOVERY DRIP SYSTEM. Both systems are operated by a timer controlled submerged pump, which is connected to a drip line that drips the nutrient solution at the base of each plant directly.</p>	
<p>The Recovery Drip system allows the excess nutrient solution to run back to the reservoir for re-use. There is a more efficient usage of nutrients in this system as they are re-used.</p>
<p>The Non-recovery Drip System does not collect the excess of the nutrient solution. It calls for a more expensive and accurate timer to ensure that only the precise quantity of nutrients is supplied to the plants. This system requires less monitoring once the initial setup is in place, as there is no need to worry about the pH and nutrient strength of the reservoir that could be affected by any run-off solution from the plants.</p>

   <p>Nutrient Film Technique uses a submersible pump in the reservoir to constantly circulate the nutrient solution to the plants. No timer is required here. The growing tray holds the plants in small plastic cups that are spaced out evenly. The nutrient solution pumped from the reservoir, flows constantly over the roots that are allowed to dangle from the plastic cups, and then drain out into the reservoir.</p>

<p>Aeroponics is the most sophisticated and advanced system of hydroponics where the roots are misted(sprayed) with the nutrient solution in very frequent intervals of time using highly accurate timers. This spraying needs to be done non-stop at very short intervals to avoid the drying up of the roots.</p>
